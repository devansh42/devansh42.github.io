For GStatic, we follow the philosophy of **KISS** *( Keep It Simple for Stupid)*.

Being a Command Line Application coded in NodeJS, its a game of single command to install **GStatic Cli**.
```bash 
     npm i -g yu-gstatic 
```
Above command will install gstatic cli globally on your machine.

Incase just want gstatic locally, use *npx*
```bash
    npm i yu-gstatic  #This commands installs the package locally

    npx gstatic --help  #Now you can gstatic along with npx, as shown here
```
