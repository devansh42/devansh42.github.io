With GStatic you can upload free websites with just one command, But how will check the status of the website, whether its is Deployed or not ?
We have a soluion, **gstatic list** command, this command will list all the projects belongs to you along with there status.
```bash
    gstatic list
```


And If you want to list only projects that are deployed at the moment use below command.
```bash
    gstatic list -d
```


#### Note
> GStatic provides you **free** domains with *gstatic.tech* suffix. That domain belongs to you as long as your site is **deployed**, as soon as you undeploy it, GStatic **detachs** that domain from your site and make it available for other users, so that we can maintain and **equal distribution** of domain among are users."
